# Regression
Regression models describe the relationship between variables by fitting a line to the observed data.
Regression allows you to estimate how a dependent variable changes as the independent variable(s) change.
# Linear Regression
Linear regression models use a straight line, while logistic and nonlinear regression models use a curved line.
